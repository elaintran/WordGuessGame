# WordGuessGame
The Word Guess Game is a vanilla JavaScript application that allows users to guess characters from the Super Mario franchise. Once a letter has been inputted from the keyboard, the application checks if it matches the letters of the selected word and updates the interface accordingly. UI was inspired by Scrabble tiles.
